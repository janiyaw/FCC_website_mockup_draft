        <div>
<p>So you want to learn to code? My personal advice would be to attend 
  a bootcamp, because they offer a structured curriculum, mentors, 
  dedicated learning time, collaboration and networking between 
  students. <br />
  <br />
  Unfortunately, not everybody who wants to learn to code can afford the money and time 
  commitment that a bootcamp requires. <br />
  <br />
  Luckily, there's an alternative that many prominent software developers have chosen: 
  the self taught route. When teaching yourself to code, you learn on your own schedule 
  using free or paid online / offline resources. <br />
  <br />
  But in order to be successful on this self learning route and jump from beginner 
  developer to junior developer quickly, you will need to incorporate some of the magic of 
  bootcamps into your self taught journey. In this article, I‚Äôll be sharing how you can do 
  that. <br />
  <br />
  Before we get started, you should know that this article was originally a <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/lindaikechukwu4/the-beginner-developers-guide-to-effective-learning" title="The Beginner Developer's Guide to Effective Learning by Linda Ikechukw" target="_blank" class="notextdecoration">talk</a> I gave at the
   Developers In Vogue MTB session. I decided to turn it into an article for more 
   accessibility after receiving some good feedback. <br />
   <br />
   So grab a cup of coffee or your favorite soda, get a pen and notepad, and jot some notes 
   down. I‚Äôll also be dropping some random quotes here and there, so brace yourselves üòä.
  </p>
  <h1>
    <strong>So how do you get started?
    </strong>
  </h1>
  <p>There are five phases you should go through when teaching yourself to code</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Pick a niche.</li>
    <li>Find structured learning resources for your niche.</li>
    <li>Learn.</li>
    <li>Build something, anything!</li>
    <li>Netowrk.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Let's go through each phase in more detail.</p>
  <h1>Pick a Niche</h1>
  <p>
    <em>‚ÄúIf you want to succeed, limit yourself.‚Äù
  </em>
  <br />
  <br />
  When starting out on your self taught developer journey, it's important that you pick a 
  niche. This makes sure that you don't overwhelm yourself. It limits your learning and 
  gives you the opportunity to devote your attention to a small subset, so you can create 
  an entry point. <br />
  <br />
  Software development is very versatile and comes in different forms. Start by getting an 
  overview of what programming and software development in general involves. <br />
  <br />
  Here are 2 good resources to give you an overview of what programming and software 
  development careers are all about.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-become-a-full-stack-web-developer-in-2020/" target="_blank" title="How to Become a Full Stack Web Developer in 2020" class="notextdecoration">How to Become a Full-Stack Web Developer in 2020</a>, by Colby Fayock</li>
  <br />
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E" title="Introduction to Programming and Computer Science on the freeCodeCamp Youtube channel" target="_blank" class="notextdecoration">Introduction to Programming and Computer Science</a> on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel</li>
</ul>
<p>After you‚Äôve gotten a general overview, you should do some inner questioning to settle 
  on a field that really excites you. Answering the questions below should help pick your 
  niche.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>What do you hope to achieve by learning to code? Do you want to make money 
      freelancing, get a good job, or build your startup idea?
      </li>
      <br />
    <li>What kind of systems do you want to build? Web (front end or back end), mobile 
      (Android or iOS), desktop, embedded, data analytics, and so on.
      </li>
  </ol>
  <p>This doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt try out new fields or experiment later on in your career, 
    but get started with one.</p>
    <h1>Find structured learning resources for your niche</h1>
    <p>Congratulations on picking a niche amidst all the choices out there.<br />
      <br />
      The next thing to do is to come up with a progressive list of topics/technologies you need 
      to learn for your niche and find structured learning resources on those topics.<br />
      <br />
      When deciding which learning resource to go for, choose those that have structural 
      progression and code along exercises for practice. Be sure to take note of these points 
      below:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>What languages and technologies are used in this field?</strong> Make a list of the 
        minimum you need to learn to achieve your goal from the previous step. The 
        emphasis is on minimum here, simply because you shouldn‚Äôt wait to learn 
        everything in your chosen field before taking the first step towards your goal. 
        You‚Äôll be waiting a really long time.
        </li> 
        <br/>
      <li><strong>What tools do you need?</strong> Find out the tools you need to learn. A code editor? 
        Some software? Go ahead and install them.
        </li>
        <br />
      <li><strong>What‚Äôs the learning order?</strong> Most fields require that you learn one tool/language 
        first before another. Remember to always start with the fundamentals and move 
        on from there.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        If you have any further questions regarding a particular niche, you can use Twitter or 
        Facebook to find people who are active in the niche you‚Äôve chosen. Drop them a 
        message and get straight to the point on what they can help you with. You‚Äôll be amazed 
        how much people in the tech community are willing to help. <br />
        <br />
        For Twitter, here is <a href="https://twitter.com/hackSultan/status/1143186098820194304?s=20" target="_blank" title="Twitter thread of people in different tech fields" class="notextdecoration blackcopy">a thread listing active people in different tech fields on twitter</a> that 
        you can follow and are open to answering questions related to their field by Hacksultan.<br />
        <br />
        And you'll find a list of great free learning resources at the end of this article.
    </p>
    <h1>Learn</h1>
    <p><em>‚ÄúIf you chase two rabbits, you will not catch any‚Äù.</em> <br />
      <br />
      Great, you‚Äôve done it. You‚Äôve figured out what you need to learn to smash your goals and 
      you‚Äôve also found a learning resource to use. Now it's time to learn those things 
      sequentially, not simultaneously.
    </p>
    <h2>Be consistent</h2>
    <p>The first thing to do is to set aside time for your learning. Set a specific time every day 
      during your daily schedule within which you‚Äôll learn and be selfish about it.<br />
      <br />
      Two hours of learning every day is a lot better than 15 hours of learning in one day, per 
      month. Here, consistency is key. You want to learn to get a job? Then you‚Äôve got to learn 
      like it's your job until you get one.
    </p>
    <h2>Set goals</h2>
    <p>
        Also, for effective learning, you have to set weekly goals so you can hold yourself 
        accountable. <br />
        <br />
        Studies have shown that people who consciously set goals are more likely to achieve 
        things. And people who go the extra mile of writing down those goals are most likely to 
        get things done.<br />
        <br />
        What do you want to know or be able to do at the end of the month? How will you 
        structure your learning per week to be able to achieve that? Write it down.
    </p>
    <h2>Stay focused</h2>
    <p>
        It's also important that you remember to focus on your outlined learning plan and your 
        chosen learning resource.<br />
        <br />
        In the tech-sphere, there‚Äôs always a shiny new object - something new to learn. Don‚Äôt get 
        carried away or overwhelmed, that‚Äôs why you‚Äôll be needing a lot of focus. One completed 
        tutorial is better than 10 sampled tutorials.
    </p>
    <h1>Build Something! Anything.</h1>
    <p><em>"The difference between you and those with talent is practice; a lot of it."      
    </em> 
    <br/>
    <br />
    As a beginner developer, it's easy to get stuck in the tutorial zone, or "tutorial hell". A lot 
    of people get stuck there, and stay beginners for way too long. This is where you watch 
    tutorial after tutorial without ever getting your hands dirty. <br />
    <br />
    Building projects is not mutually exclusive to the learning phase. You have to constantly 
    iterate between learning and building because learning never actually ends.<br />
    <br />
    This is why I emphasized choosing learning resources that feature a lot of code-along 
    projects to get you started practicing. Make sure to code along and not just watch. This 
    helps you get started making something. <br />
    <br />
    One way to get some practice is, at the end of every module, think of features that you 
    can add to the project that you‚Äôve coded. Just try to build something with the new 
    knowledge that you have gained.<br />
<br />
It doesn't have to be too fancy. The most important thing is that you write code, run into 
errors, google how to debug it, and gain more understanding. Practice solidifies 
knowledge, so practice. 1 completed project is better than 10 watched tutorials.<br />
<br />
You can use google to find project ideas, or check out <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/here-are-some-app-ideas-you-can-build-to-level-up-your-coding-skills-39618291f672/" title="App Ideas to Build to Level Up Coding Skills" target="_blank" class="notextdecoration">these fun ones</a>.
    </p>
    <h1>Network</h1>
    <p>To network simply means to learn in public and put yourself out there. You don‚Äôt stand to 
      gain much if you‚Äôre a silo. So, how do you put yourself out there?</p>
      <h2>Join a community & Attend Meetups</h2>
      <p>
          A community challenges you and inspires you at the same time. You become aware of 
          people who are in the same field as you are, with the same struggles you have. You‚Äôll also 
          get the opportunity to collaborate and form lifelong friendships.<br />
<br />
Here is <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/best-developer-communities-to-be-part-of-in-2020/" target="_blank" title="The Best Developer Communities to Join in 2020" class="notextdecoration">list of some global remote tech communities you can join</a> by Bolaji Ayodeji. Also 
look for local communities in your city too.
      </p>
      <h2>Sell yourself</h2>
      <p>Opportunity no longer comes to the most qualified ‚Äì it goes to the most visibly qualified.<br />
        <br />
        Selling yourself means talking about yourself and what you‚Äôre currently doing. This gives 
        you more exposure and could open up a lot of opportunities for you.<br />
        <br />
        Set up a GitHub account and push code there. Start a twitter account and talk about 
        what you‚Äôre learning or building.</p>
        <h2>Ask questions</h2>
        <p>Asking engaging questions is another way to network and introduce yourself to other 
          people. There is really no shame in asking questions.<br />
          <br />
          If you get stuck on a particular problem, use social media and your physical connections 
          to your advantage. Learn to slide into people's DMs and emails. The only reason you may 
          not get a reply is if you don't know how to word your request well.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Tip:</strong> When reaching out, it‚Äôs best to send a few prepared questions as opposed to just 
          sending a ‚ÄòHi‚Äô and asking for their time.<br />
          <br />
          You should put together a list of questions that will answer the challenges you‚Äôre 
          currently facing. You‚Äôre more likely to get a response if someone knows upfront what 
          kind of time commitment they‚Äôre making.<br />
          <br />
          A sample message could be:<br />
          <br />
        </p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-self-taught-developers-guide-to-coding/">
  <p>
      "Hello, my name is (insert name here), I hope you‚Äôre doing fine. I have been seeing your 
        content for a while and I see you‚Äôre knowledgeable in (insert field here). I‚Äôve been trying to 
          understand (insert challenge here). I have tried (insert approaches you've taken to try to solve 
            your challenge) Could you help (insert what you need). Thanks."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>
      I hope this article has brought some clarity to your journey on learning to code as a 
      beginner.<br />
      <br />
      One last thing: coding is difficult, and learning on your own can be even tougher. You‚Äôll 
      definitely come across some bad days.<br />
      <br />
      Just remember to go easy on yourself on days when things don‚Äôt make any sense. In the 
      long run, your consistency and perseverance towards learning will definitely pay off.<br />
      <br />
      Now go on and be great!<br />
